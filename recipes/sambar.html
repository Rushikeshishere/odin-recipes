    <p>
        Sambar is a traditional South Indian lentil stew that is loved for its rich flavors and versatility. It is made
        by combining cooked lentils with a medley of vegetables like brinjal, carrots, beans, and tomatoes. The dish is
        flavored with a blend of aromatic spices and tamarind pulp, giving it a tangy and slightly sour taste. Sambar is
        often enjoyed with steamed rice or as an accompaniment to dosa and idli. Its comforting and nutritious qualities
        make it a popular choice in South Indian cuisine, providing a satisfying and wholesome meal option.

        </li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.</li>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes and green chillies. Cook until the tomatoes become soft.</li>
